      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been on a diet except when I was pregnant. That seems ironic, since people usually look at pregnancy as the once chance in a woman&amp;rsquo;s life to indulge and to &amp;ldquo;eat whatever you want&amp;rdquo;. This seems particularly prominent in American culture - &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re eating for two!&amp;rdquo; etc.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been very active - I was a basketball player in both high school and college. Played volleyball and also picked up rock climbing in grad school.</description>
