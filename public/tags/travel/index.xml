      <description>As stated before, I returned to work early so I could save some time to travel to Taiwan with the baby to visit family. We just returned from the trip! It was a very fun experience, even though it was a ton of work - I would call it a real &amp;ldquo;baby bonding leave&amp;rdquo; compared to my previous maternity leave.
It was an ambitious trip, since we were in Taiwan for over 3 weeks, we decided that instead of spending the entire time at my parents&amp;rsquo; house, we would take a trip to the east coast of Taiwan by train, and spend a week touring around.</description>
