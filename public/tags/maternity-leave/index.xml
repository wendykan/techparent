      <description>To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect going into maternity leave. I had never been the &amp;ldquo;mom-type&amp;rdquo;, and just the idea of stay at home all the time with a newborn kind of scared me.

      <description>The anxiety Months before I even started my maternity leave, I felt very anxious about that &amp;ldquo;break time&amp;rdquo;: what would it be like? Would it be just me and the baby sitting at home, me slaving away, desperately waiting for anyone to come rescue us? I started asking people questions about what they do at this time.
 Friend A: Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you&amp;rsquo;ll be SO BUSY with the baby, you won&amp;rsquo;t even worry about what to do.</description>
