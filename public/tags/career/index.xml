      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been back at work from maternity leave for about 2 months now. It&amp;rsquo;s been a journey coming back to work, to say the least.
First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m SO HAPPY to be back at work! I took exactly 3 months of leave, and will save the rest of the baby-bonding leave for a family trip to Taiwan for 4 weeks. For me, the first month of leave was necessary for the body to recover, and the second month was more of a getting-to-know-the-baby time, and the third month was the real baby-bonding, mainly on sleep training the baby, learning to get out of the house and travel a bit, and that was when I started to crave for human (adult) interaction and when I started to write this blog :)</description>

      <description>To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect going into maternity leave. I had never been the &amp;ldquo;mom-type&amp;rdquo;, and just the idea of stay at home all the time with a newborn kind of scared me. I thought it would be very isolated, very exhausting, and very desperate. I asked a lot of friends for help, and usually they told me: &amp;ldquo;Oh, you won&amp;rsquo;t have time to worry about this.</description>
