      <description>I never imagined myself as someone who shares parenting advice. Growing up, I&amp;rsquo;m simply not a &amp;ldquo;mom type&amp;rdquo;. In fact, for most of the time in my life, I did not want children - I am simply too career focused, persuing an intellectual lifestyle; so chasing after a toddler and being bothered with milk supply didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like my thing.
So why am I blogging now? Well, after I married a great guy, we started to dream about having a family.</description>
