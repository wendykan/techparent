      <description>Disclaimer:
 I&amp;rsquo;m not a baby whisperer - I&amp;rsquo;m actually far from it. I&amp;rsquo;m more of a hacker, as is the title of this blog. So please don&amp;rsquo;t use this article as your sleep training bible!
 I initially started writing this post in January and never finished it. Thank you Alexa for nudging me for this one!
   Newborns cry&amp;hellip; wanting something. Sometimes they know what they want, but most of the time they don&amp;rsquo;t know what they want, and neither do we know what they want.</description>

      <title>Traveling Overseas With 6-month Baby</title>

      <description>As stated before, I returned to work early so I could save some time to travel to Taiwan with the baby to visit family. We just returned from the trip! It was a very fun experience, even though it was a ton of work - I would call it a real &amp;ldquo;baby bonding leave&amp;rdquo; compared to my previous maternity leave.
It was an ambitious trip, since we were in Taiwan for over 3 weeks, we decided that instead of spending the entire time at my parents&amp;rsquo; house, we would take a trip to the east coast of Taiwan by train, and spend a week touring around.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from my first two months as a working mom</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been back at work from maternity leave for about 2 months now. It&amp;rsquo;s been a journey coming back to work, to say the least.
First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m SO HAPPY to be back at work! I took exactly 3 months of leave, and will save the rest of the baby-bonding leave for a family trip to Taiwan for 4 weeks. For me, the first month of leave was necessary for the body to recover, and the second month was more of a getting-to-know-the-baby time, and the third month was the real baby-bonding, mainly on sleep training the baby, learning to get out of the house and travel a bit, and that was when I started to crave for human (adult) interaction and when I started to write this blog :)</description>

      <title>Why Breastfeeding vs Formula is just like Tabs vs Spaces</title>

      <description>For the first month of my baby&amp;rsquo;s life, I struggled through the whole breastfeeding thing. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into too much details, so some bullet points of events/struggles:
 The baby was born early (but full term), so he was very sleepy, preferred sleeping over eating.
 He wasn&amp;rsquo;t latching on correctly (although, he was always too sleepy to actually tell if he had a good latch or not).</description>

      <title>How I came to embrace being a mom</title>

      <description>This is a strange topic to write. I feel like by writing this, I&amp;rsquo;m going to seem like the reluctant mom, where my pregnancy was unplanned. But it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite - the pregnancy was very much looked forward to. So, one would find it hard to discover that&amp;hellip;
I never wanted to be a mom.
I wanted to maybe have children, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that having children would, inevitably, make me a mother.</description>

      <title>How My Work Experience Helped Me Stay Sane Caring for a Newborn</title>

      <description>To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect going into maternity leave. I had never been the &amp;ldquo;mom-type&amp;rdquo;, and just the idea of stay at home all the time with a newborn kind of scared me. I thought it would be very isolated, very exhausting, and very desperate. I asked a lot of friends for help, and usually they told me: &amp;ldquo;Oh, you won&amp;rsquo;t have time to worry about this.</description>

      <title>How to Lose Pregnancy Weight by Not Gaining Weight</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been on a diet except when I was pregnant. That seems ironic, since people usually look at pregnancy as the once chance in a woman&amp;rsquo;s life to indulge and to &amp;ldquo;eat whatever you want&amp;rdquo;. This seems particularly prominent in American culture - &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re eating for two!&amp;rdquo; etc.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been very active - I was a basketball player in both high school and college. Played volleyball and also picked up rock climbing in grad school.</description>

      <description>The anxiety Months before I even started my maternity leave, I felt very anxious about that &amp;ldquo;break time&amp;rdquo;: what would it be like? Would it be just me and the baby sitting at home, me slaving away, desperately waiting for anyone to come rescue us? I started asking people questions about what they do at this time.
 Friend A: Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you&amp;rsquo;ll be SO BUSY with the baby, you won&amp;rsquo;t even worry about what to do.</description>

      <title>Why I started this blog</title>
      <link>https://wendyhackermom.com/post/why-this-blog/</link>

      <description>I never imagined myself as someone who shares parenting advice. Growing up, I&amp;rsquo;m simply not a &amp;ldquo;mom type&amp;rdquo;. In fact, for most of the time in my life, I did not want children - I am simply too career focused, persuing an intellectual lifestyle; so chasing after a toddler or being bothered with milk supply didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like my thing.
So why am I blogging now? Well, after I married a great guy, we started to dream about having a family.</description>
