Newborns cry... wanting *something*. Sometimes they know what they want, but most of the time they don't know what they want, and neither do we know what they want. But overall, for young babies, the reasons are simply:

- need food
- wet diaper
- tired

ps. I learned these from our nanny, who actually IS the baby whisperer. 

In the early days of the newborn's life, we woke up every 2 hours, sometimes even every hour (on some bad nights) to feed the baby. It was extremely exhausting and frankly terrible. Fortunately, those days didn't last that long.
