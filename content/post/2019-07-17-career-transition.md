This is quite a difficult post to write. I've been struggling with my career path for the past months, and I think it was related to my maternity leave and new motherhood status. Fortunately, as I'm making some changes to my career (I recently transitioned to a different role within the same company), I'm feeling a lot more refreshed and hope to share some lessons learned along the way.

## My own journey

I've been very comfortable with my job, even though it's a stressful job, it's very exciting. I've established myself within the team and the company in the past few years. Therefore, when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't follow my own desire to make some changes to my job, since I thought I was good at my job and it would be good to come back to the same job along with the pregnancy and after coming back from giving birth to the baby. 

I was very wrong. I came back from the maternity leave, and even though I really longed for "intelligent work", I felt like I had a lot to catch up on, learning new processes that my team had changed, I had to re-establish myself, and I had to prove my own worth again. All these were not hard to do, given my previous experience in the team; but I wasn't motivated at all. It was because I was already stagnant in my career, and coming back from maternity leave only made it less motivating and not more.  

I’ve been giving this advice to my friends who are either expecting or trying to conceive. Many of them go through the thought process about whether they should make changes to their careers with consideration of the upcoming/possible family changes. After going through it myself, I feel very strongly that everyone who is considering a change in career should try to do it **before** they get pregnant or **before** they give birth. Or rather, **just do it and don’t wait for anything**. 

## The ugly reality: just by you being "away", it affects your career.  

This was a hard reality to swallow, especially when I was torn between a newborn at home, spending a lot of time on producing breastmilk (this is like a part time job), a job that I loved but seemingly couldn’t stand anymore, and feeling undervalued and having to prove my worth from ground up. 

I talked to a few friends, and they all felt for me. They responded that a lot of women experience this and a lot of them quit their jobs, or switch careers, or switch teams, after they come back from maternity leave. **How come we didn’t know this before? I guess they never talked about it?**

It's more common than you think - people quitting their jobs after having kid(s). 

## Suggestion 1: If you're already thinking about a career change, plan for it, start some ground work. Don't wait. 

If you're thinking about a career change, it's actually a very good time to work on switching things up before or even during your pregnancy. Even though pregnancy is itself a challenge for most people, it's still good to at least think about what kind of change you'd like to bring into your professional life. Job transitions can take months to build up - you need to talk to different people, sending and analyzing signals of different opportunities in your network, and maybe actually work on refreshing your resume. So it's always good to start early and make the change before pregnancy, before childbirth, or even after childbirth. Just remember, that job search is only going to be less pleasant when you're extremely unhappy about your job and having a newborn that you have to care for. So starting it earlier is always better than later. 

## Suggestion 2: If you're happy where you are, great! Please embrace the fact that your work and progress will be stalled when you are away. Try to make the best out of it and catch up quickly. 

I believe there are people who are perfectly happy with where they are in their career pre-, during- and post-pregnancy. That is so great!! But do remember, if you are away for a while, someone will have to pick up your slack, and they do deserve the credit of their work. Also, depending on how long you're gone, things might change, and you might find it a shock when you come back to work that 


In hindsight, it feels like the pregnancy/childbirth gave us an excuse/opportunity to reset and restart our careers. It’s a bit of a heavy topic and I don’t love to post this, but your maternity leave does impact your career in some way. Not all "impacts" are negative, but it definitely was a surprise for me since I was expecting there to be none or minimal impact. 

If you're reading this, I hope yours will be a happy transition for your career as well, whatever you ended up doing!
