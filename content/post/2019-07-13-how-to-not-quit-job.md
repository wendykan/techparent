> Disclaimer: I am extremely fortunate to have a well paying job, very helpful social circle of mom friends, and super supportive employer to empower me to explore what I like to do in my career. I wanted to note down my journey to let others prepare for this transition in case things don’t line up like this. 

## My own transition

Lately, I have transitioned into a different role at work (within the same company) and couldn’t be happier! I feel so refreshed every day and so productive at work. In my previous role, even though I really loved the job, I had been with the same job for 4+ years and felt that I had plateaued and was seriously burned out. 

I feel that this transition could have happened earlier, but the entire pregnancy/childbirth last year factored into the decision and motivation to change jobs/roles, which in retrospect was unnecessary. I really wish I had worked on switching jobs/roles earlier to prevent myself from being unhappy post-child. 

I’ve been giving this advice to my friends who are either expecting or trying to conceive. Many of them go through the thought process about whether they should make changes to their careers with consideration of the upcoming/possible family changes. After going through it myself, I feel very strongly that everyone who is considering a change in career should try to do it **before** they get pregnant or **before** they give birth. Or rather, **just do it and don’t wait for anything**. 

### The misconception
**“I am good at my job, but I’m a bit tired/bored of it. But I shouldn’t make any changes because I’ll have an easier time coming back to work after maternity leave.” - WRONG. You’d only be more tired/bored after you come back to the same job.**


### The struggle

When I came back to my job after 3 months of leave, I felt very welcomed and was quickly given new tasks to work on. Being the more senior member of the team, the team was happy to have me back and start contributing and carrying heavy workload again. At the same time, they were still very considerate when I had to spend much of my time in the mother’s room pumping, or taking calls from the mother’s room, or work from home. For any first time mother, it was a very welcoming environment to get back to “normal”.

Except that I didn’t want to get back to “normal”. I felt like the teammates were covering for me when I was on leave, and I felt like I had to hand-over projects that I put in so much time on and have someone else enjoy the credit. They made some changes to processes in my absence, which I could quickly learn and be up to speed again, but.... honestly I just didn’t want to. I was tired. 

### The journey of finding myself
Good thing I had already established seniority at my job. I started to have some ideas for new, innovative projects, and after much discussion with the management chain, got support to run them. It eventually worked out well for me. During this process, I spent a lot of time talking with folks from other parts of the company, and eventually scoped out a role that I was excited about, and transitioned to that role recently. This was not a short process - it took almost 9 months for things to settle and it was not easy for me. 

Mentally and emotionally it was quite a bit of struggle. I was torn between a newborn at home, spending a lot of time on producing breastmilk (this is like a part time job), a job that I loved but seemingly couldn’t stand anymore, and feeling undervalued and having to prove my worth from ground up. I talked to a few friends, and they all felt for me. They responded that a lot of women experience this and a lot of them quit their jobs, or switch careers, or switch teams, after they come back from maternity leave. **How come we didn’t know this before? I guess they never talked about it?**

### It's more common than you think - people quitting their jobs after having kid(s)
A close friend of mine shared her journey with me. She said she had to hand over her big project that she worked very hard on. She even gave birth early because the project was demanding. When she came back to work, the project had already launched, and the coworker who inherited the project got great praise, and she was left with not-so-good projects and had to prove herself again. She eventually left the team after about 6 months, into a completely different team of the same company, and is quite happy about the change. 

I need to mention that both she and I didn’t and couldn’t blame our coworkers who took the credit from our projects while we were on leave. They did inherit the projects, and they did have to carry extra workload to cover for us and to push the projects forward. So they deserve that credit. But it’s also valid for the original person who involuntarily had to leave the work to feel left out, and to feel insecure/worried that our performance review would get impacted, therefore stalling our progression in our careers, whether it’s getting promoted or other progressions we've been working on. 

I’m glad that things eventually worked out for us.  

In hindsight, it feels like the pregnancy/childbirth gave us an excuse/opportunity to reset and restart our careers. It’s a bit of a heavy topic and I don’t love to post this, but your maternity leave does impact your career in some way. Not all "impacts" are negative, but it definitely was a surprise for me since I was expecting there to be none or minimal impact. 

If you're reading this, I hope yours will be a happy transition for your career as well, whatever you ended up doing!
