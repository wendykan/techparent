# How to not quit your job after maternity leave

> Disclaimer: I am extremely fortunate to have a well paying job, very helpful social circle, and super supportive employer to explore and find what I like to do in my career. I wanted to note down my journey to let others prepare for this transition in case things don’t line up as lucky as this. 

Lately, I have transitioned into a different role at work (within the same company) and couldn’t be happier! I feel so refreshed every day and so productive at work. In my previous role, even though I really loved the job, I had been with the same job for 4+ years and felt that I had plateaued and was seriously burned out. 

I feel that this transition could have happened earlier, but the entire pregnancy/childbirth last year factored into the decision and motivation to change jobs/roles, which in retrospect was unnecessary. I really wish I had worked on switching jobs/roles earlier to prevent myself from being unhappy post-child. 

I’ve been giving this advice to my friends who are either expecting or trying to conceive. Many of them go through the thought process about whether they should make changes to their careers with consideration of the upcoming/possible family changes. After going through it myself, I feel very strongly that everyone who is considering a change in career should try to do it **before** they get pregnant or **before** they give birth. Or rather, **just do it and don’t wait for anything**. 

### “I am good at my job, but I’m a bit tired/bored of it. But I shouldn’t make any changes because I’ll have an easier time coming back to work after maternity leave.” - WRONG. You’d only be more tired/bored after you come back to the same job. 

When I came back to my job after 3 months of leave, I felt very welcomed and was quickly given new tasks to work on. Being the more senior member of the team, the team was happy to have me back and start contributing and carrying heavy workload again. At the same time, they were still very considerate when I had to spend much of my time in the mother’s room pumping, or taking calls from the mother’s room, or work from home. For any first time mother, it was a very welcoming environment to get back to “normal”.

Except that I didn’t want to get back to “normal”. I felt like the team mates were covering for me when I was on leave, and I felt like I had to hand-over  made some changes to processes in my absence. I could quickly learn them and be up to speed again, but I was already kind of tired of the same tasks. So ultimately, I started to propose new projects, the new technologies that I had some time to read about during my maternity leave, and eventually got the support to run those new ideas as my new projects. It eventually worked out well for me. But I had to go through quite a bit of mental and emotional struggles to realize that with a baby at home, my time has to be very optimized at work, and working on something that doesn’t interest me anymore is really not worth it.
