# How to not quit your job after maternity leave

Lately, I have transitioned into a different role at work (within the same company) and couldn’t be happier. I feel so refreshed every day and so productive. In my previous role, even though I really loved the job, I had been with the same job for 4+ years and felt very plateaued 

I’ve been giving these advice to my friends who are 1. expecting 2. trying to conceive. Many of them go through the thought process about whether they should make changes to their careers with consideration of the upcoming/possible family changes. After going through it myself, I feel very strongly that everyone who is considering a change in career should try to do it **before** they get pregnant or at least **before** they give birth. 

### “I am good at my job, but I’m a bit tired/bored of it. But I shouldn’t make any changes because I’ll have an easier time coming back to work after maternity leave.” - WRONG. 

The truth is, if you’re bored/tired of your job already, you’ll very likely be even more bored/tired of it when you come back to it after the maternity leave.
