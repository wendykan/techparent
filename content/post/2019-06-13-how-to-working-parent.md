> This is a post requested by Alexis again :) 

It has been about 7 months since I came back to work, and the baby is now over 10 months old! It's been a really fun experience watching him grow into his own person, having his own personality. He's also developing very nicely - he can now pull himself up from sitting, and is generally a very happy boy! Overall, I'm feeling super content as a working mom. I think the whole "mom status" made me more tired (LOL), but much more strategic, and a lot more efficient at work. 

I'll talk about my work mentality changes in another blog post later :)  


Who is taking care of the baby while you work? I have had a few people say to me: oh, since you can work from home, you can take care of the baby in the meantime. This is an absolute NO! Taking care of a baby is full time work. I have thought about entertaining this idea, but even just for 2 hours of watching the baby after the nanny has left, it was very difficult to get any work done. I have tried a little programming or watching some machine learning videos while holding the baby, but after he got strong enough, it's impossible to stop him from wanting to play with the keyboard. 

## Child care while you work

A few things are very basic when you go to work:

### 1. Nanny

We are fortunate that we can afford the luxury to hire a nanny - from the day that we went back to work up until now. We found her on Care.com and she's been amazing. She is a Brazillian lady 

### 2. Nanny share


### 3. Daycare


### 4. Work from home or go to office?


## Child care while you're not at work

### Commute

### Adjusting hours
