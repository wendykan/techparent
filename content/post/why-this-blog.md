### I never imagined myself as someone who shares parenting advice. 

Growing up, I'm simply not a "mom type". In fact, for most of the time in my life, I did not want children - I am simply too career focused, persuing an intellectual lifestyle; so chasing after a toddler or being bothered with milk supply didn't seem like my thing. 

So why am I blogging now? Well, after I married a great guy, we started to dream about having a family. We actually struggled quite a bit to get pregnant, and then suffered an ectopic pregnancy. Then diagnosed with "unexplained infertility". We were blessed to get pregnant naturally after that diagnosis. 

I was quite busy with work during my entire pregnancy, also was physically exhausted from the pregnancy. So I didn't do much research about all the baby-topics. 

### There is overwhelmingly too much information on the internet for new parents. What makes it even worse is that they all contradict each other. I just want a simple way out. 

During my maternity leave, I browse on the internet a lot on don't find most of the parenting blogs too helpful. I honestly find most of the mom blogs too labor-intensive. 
I had troubles with breastfeeding (and I still do!), I don't know what to do with sleep training, etc. I hate mommy's groups and don't like most of the methods that are supposedly good for the baby but will make my life miserable. I started asking like-minded friends on their ways of parenting and learned a lot from their experience. The thing is, these career-moms are simply too busy to write anything down, so their voices aren't very loud on the internet. 

I'm fortunate enough to have a longer, paid maternity leave from work. And even more fortunate that I have help from family, and my husband can also take a good amount of paternity leave. This leaves me some (very fragmented) free time during my maternity leave to learn new things, and I plan to share them on this blog. I also view it as an opportunity to learn about using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I intentionally picked a tool that requires some technical skills, so it's a lightweight technical project for me to tackle while juggling the baby in my one arm :)
